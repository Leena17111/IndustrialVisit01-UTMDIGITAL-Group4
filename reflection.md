The visit to UTM DIGITAL was truly inspiring, as I admired their commitment to improving their services and using technology to enhance processes. It showed me the importance of innovation in the digital world and motivated me to pursue a career in web development. Seeing how they solve real-world problems in our university through technology encouraged me to aim for creating impactful and efficient websites in the future. However, I wish they included interactive or hands-on sessions during this visit so I could have in-depth experience.
